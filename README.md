#### A classy approach.

Did you ever wanted to organize your styles properly? This library contains an easy to use API that lets you organize your styles in a classy way.

## Installation

```
npm install @rootstrap/react-native-use-styles --save
```

## Usage

### Global styles

```js
import { GlobalStyles } from "react-native-use-styles";

GlobalStyles({
  global: "fx:1 fx:dir:row"
});
```

Note that we are using aliases for the styles. You can use classic object notation if you want to.

### Namespaced styles

```js
import { Styles } from "react-native-use-styles";

export default Styles({
  reused: "bg:color:green",
  local: ".global .reused color:purple"
});
```

Note that we are exporting the result of our definition. We'll use it next.

### Using styles

```js
import useStyles from "./my-namespaced-styles";

const component = () â‡’ {
  const s = useStyles();

  return (
    <Text styles={s`.global .local`}>
      Hello World!
    </Text>
  );
}
```

Note that we are classy now, and nobody would deny it.

## Performance

This library was created with performance in mind. In summary, useStyles has multiple cache layers to avoid unnecessary renders, calculations and transformations.
